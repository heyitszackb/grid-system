# robots

Currently a WIP, however main should always be functioning.
I love systems, so I am working on creating a game where the player needs to create a system of autonomous robots to complete goals, build more robots, and make a bigger and better system. Inspired by Factorio and Minecraft, and mostly for my personal coding joy.
My vision for this projects includes:
- Programmable robots
- Many building types
- Beautiful aesthetics (way down the line...)
- Resource collection
- ...and more!

### Setup instructions
1. Inside of `Robot` directory: `pip install pyxel`.
2. Run `pyxel run main.py`
